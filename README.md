 A Python game interface and animation library designed to allow players to act out a character using physicality rather than dialogue

 Please note that this repository is currently being used to maintain a copy of Puppitor separate from its game development branch and 
 as such will not be updated frequently. The system is still in development and will not have documentation or examples created for 
 public use for some time.
